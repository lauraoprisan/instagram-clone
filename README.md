## Description of the App
This is a basic instagram clone that I have build by following this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMScMwY2B6Q&t=2441s. Most of the frontend is done by me in css, and not by using chackra-ui as in the video.

The app is build with React and Firebase.

## Observations

The src/firebase/firebase.js does not appear in the most of the previous commits, and if you want to run the app in a certain point of the project add it!

Do not forget to add the .env file!

The vercel.json file is added to solve some 404 errors. This is caused by vite.

## Optimisations

Some optimisations are:
- adjusting the height of the comment while writing it
- making a loading component that actually looks nice for feedposts, profile posts
- make a spinner loader for buttons
- show toast (like showing info box with error in signup/login) would be nice
- adding new features (for at least the UI that currently exists)
